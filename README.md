# node-app-template

Use this template to get started building a NodeJS Express application. This template can be used on its own, but it is more useful when used in conjuction with the react-app-template repo at https://github.com/sunilab/react-app-template.

Run the node server using the command 'npm start'. The default site is a static application deployed from the react-app-template application. See deployment instructions below. 

Use the 'npm run build' command from the react-app-template application to compile the React application and deploy it to this node app.
